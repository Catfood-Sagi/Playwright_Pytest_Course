------------------
Taking a Screenshot

After we use the goto navigation, lets say we want to take a screenshot of the page
we can use
page.screenshot(path="path where to save the img") - we can use png or jpg
We can also take a screenshot of a specific element. 

----------------------
Recording a Video

we will need to import playwright browser
this require a broswer context.
we will need to provide arg to record the session

    context = browser.new_context(
        record_video_dir="video/"
    )

we are providing a directory 

you can also use it as fixture

-------------------------
Tracing 

    context.tracing.start(
        name="playwright", # name of the trace
        screenshots=True, # we can see screenshots frame by frame
        snapshots=True,   #
        sources=True,     # soucre code of each action

helpful tip:
1. You can run playwright show-trace <file name>
2. Can also open it from trace.playwright.dev website
